COMMANDS = '''- /add to add a transaction to the list.
- /list to view the current pending transactions.
- /detail followed by a number from /list to show details of a transaction.
- /delete followed by a number from /list to remove a transaction.
- /settle to settle up all pending transactions. This will remove all transactions.
- /help to bring up the available instructions and format.'''

ASSUMPTIONS = '''- Amounts support up to 2 decimal digits. Any rounding difference in division will go to the payer.
- Each transaction requires at least 1 debtor. Otherwise what's the point honestly.'''

EXPLAINER = '''How it works:
- If a debtor's amount is specified in a transaction, that share will first be deducted from the amount.
- The remaining amount will be split amongst all debtors that do not have an amount specified.
- The bot will then calculate all relationships between transactions to come up with a final tally.

Tips:
- Make sure the spelling of each name is consitent across transactions. The name is not case sensitive.
