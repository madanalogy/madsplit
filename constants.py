EXAMPLES = '''== Examples ==

John paid for dinner, everyone pays exactly what they ordered:
/add Dinner, 242, John
Andy, 62
Bob, 78

Bob paid for drinks, evenly split amongst all parties:
/add Drinks, 654, Bob
Andy
John

Andy paid for breakfast, and boy was he not happy about that:
/add Breakfast, 120, Andy
Andy, 10
Mary
Bob
John

Bob takes a cab back with Mary and adding John's stop was only $7:
/add Cab Ride, 42.50, Bob
John, 7
Mary'''

COMMANDS = '''- /add to add a transaction to the list.
- /list to view the current pending transactions.
- /detail followed by a number from /list to show details of a transaction.
- /delete followed by a number from /list to remove a transaction.
- /settle to settle up all pending transactions. This will remove all transactions.
- /help to bring up the available instructions and format.'''

ASSUMPTIONS = '''Tips:
- Make sure the spelling of each name is consistent across transactions. The name is not case sensitive.
- Amounts support up to 2 decimal digits. There might be a small rounding difference in division.
- If the payer is also a debtor in the same transaction, there must be an amount indicated.
- Each transaction requires at least 1 debtor.'''

EXPLAINER = '''How it works:
- If a debtor's amount is specified in a transaction, that share will first be deducted from the amount.
- The remaining amount will be split evenly amongst the payer and all debtors that do not have an amount specified.
- The payer will not be included in the even split only if the payer is also a debtor with an amount specified.
- The /settle command will then calculate all relationships between transactions to come up with a final tally.
