# MadSplit_Bot

Telegram bot to manage transactions amongst various parties. Interact via private message or add it to a group!

Try it out here: [t.me/madsplit_bot](https://t.me/madsplit_bot)

## Commands
- `/add` to add a transaction to the list.
- `/list` to view the current pending transactions.
- `/detail` followed by a number from `/list` to show details of a transaction.
- `/delete` followed by a number from `/list` to remove a transaction.
- `/settle` to settle up all pending transactions. This will remove all transactions.
- `/help` to print out the general help information

### Examples
```
John paid for dinner, everyone pays exactly what they ordered:
/add Dinner, 242, John
Andy, 62
Bob, 78

Bob paid for drinks, evenly split amongst all parties:
/add Drinks, 654, Bob
Andy
John

Andy paid for breakfast, and boy was he not happy about that:
/add Breakfast, 120, Andy
Andy, 10
Mary
Bob
John

Bob was gonna cab back with Mary but John asked if they could add a stop:
/add Cab Ride, 42.50, Bob
John, 7.50
Mary
```

Keying in `/list` should then give you an output like this:

```
1. Dinner, $242.00, John
2. Drinks, $654.00, Bob
3. Breakfast, $120.00, Andy
4. Cab Ride, $42.50, Bob
```

You can then reference the list index to delete a transaction or view more details about it.

```
/detail 1

/delete 2
```

Finally once you're happy with the transactions recorded. Use `/settle` to calculate the final tally!
- The `/settle` operation will also remove all transaction data stored.


## How it works
1. If a debtor's amount is specified in a transaction, that share will first be deducted from the amount.
2. The remaining amount will be split evenly amongst the payer and all debtors that do not have an amount specified.
    - The payer will not be included in the even split only if the payer is also a debtor with an amount specified.
3. The /settle command will then calculate all relationships between transactions to come up with a final tally.

### Tips
- Make sure the spelling of each name is consistent across transactions. The name is not case sensitive.
- Amounts support up to 2 decimal digits. There might be a small rounding difference in division.
- If the payer is also a debtor in the same transaction, there must be an amount indicated.
- Each transaction requires at least 1 debtor.
